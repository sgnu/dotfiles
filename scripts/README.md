## upscale

Downloads an image and upscales it using [waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x).

### Usage

```sh
upscale $URL $IMAGE_NAME
```

`$URL` is a direct link to the image.
`$IMAGE_NAME` is the desired name of the upscaled image.
The script places images inside of `$HOME/walls`, but that can be changed in the script.
